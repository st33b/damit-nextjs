# Website for the Dallas Area Masters Invitational Tournament (DAMIT)
## An [IGBO](http://www.igbo.org)-affiliated tournament

It's built as a static website using the [Next.js](http://nextjs.org) framework and was bootstrapped with [`create-next-app`](https://github.com/vercel/next.js/tree/canary/packages/create-next-app).

It's also the project I'm using to familiarize myself with [Material Design](https://mui.com), first via [MDB](https://mdbootstrap.com) using Bootstrap 5+.

This will be fleshed out once the website is deployed.

## Info we need

- Logo / branding
  - Theme color: "electric purple" -- #958cba and #7c72a6
- High-level overview
- What makes DAMIT different
- Link to registration
- Schedule
- Bowling House
- Map
- Host Hotel? (probably not)
- Dallas (info about the city, for visitors)
- Rules
- Contacts
- Results
- Interesting / Useful links (other IGBO tournaments, local leagues)

## Strategy

- Put it all on a single page, except for the rules, which shall live on their own
- Have a nav bar for each section
  - Clicking a nav item scrolls you to that item
  - Nav is always visible (sticky on desktop; menu button/bar is sticky on small viewports)
